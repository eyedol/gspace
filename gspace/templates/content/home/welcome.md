Ghana is poised to be an ICT hub for West Africa. With a growing population of nearly **24 million**, more than *50 percent* of whom are under the age of 24, Ghana represents a sizable market for both consumption+ and production of ICT services.

With **70%** of the population being mobile phone subscribers and with an increasing number of them using second generation phones, Ghana is a fertile ground for mobile and web applications.
