We are interested in implementing a gspace because we believe Ghana's tech, innovation and entreprising community needs a home to convene, network and build together. 

The gspace will be a space that will serve **three** areas of interest. Community space for teamwork forging partnership and networking, space to host tech-related as well as other entrepreneurship focused meetings, events, etc. and a space to host resources for developers and tech enthusiasts.
