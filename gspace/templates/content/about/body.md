Why?
----

We are interested in implementing a gspace because we believe Ghana's tech, innovation and entreprising community needs a home to convene, network and build together. 

The gspace will be a space that will serve **three** areas of interest. Community space for teamwork forging partnership and networking, space to host tech-related as well as other entrepreneurship focused meetings, events, etc. and a space to host resources for developers and tech enthusiasts.

Vision
------

The gspace is a creative and stimulating space for aspiring technologists and entrepreneurs to incubate and launch the next generation of killer apps and services for Ghana and beyond. 

Built on a highly collaborative and community driven model, this open space in Accra facilitates the skilling, generation of- and exposure to- novel ideas needed to foster a more innovative technology and business community in Ghana. 

Mission
-------

The goal is to create a tech community space in Accra.

Ghana has the very real potential to become the tech hub in West Africa. Ghana has most of the ingredients - human capital, improving infrastructure, increasing investment, a growing economy and a rising consumer and business to business demand for technology. What we are missing, is a place for these elements to intersect. 

Today, putting together a community meet-up, training or event to take advantage of a world class speaker coming to Ghana, is logistically complicated and costly. These barriers to entry have enormous opportunity costs to the value that human collaboration and sharing can provide. This innovation space in Accra will serve as the connector for these opportunities to meet. 

The space will also include a mobile lab with hardware, that can be checked out on a loaner basis. This will allow developers, techies and businesses to test their products.
